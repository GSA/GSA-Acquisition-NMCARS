      <p id="jnIVKV" outputclass="Normal">(c) The use of VECPs are encouraged due to the potential savings and system improvements that may be realized.</p>

      <p id="zyJQae" outputclass="List2">(2) When considering VECPs, contracting officers shall consider the impact on the projected savings that the normal negotiation and definitization process would have versus use of an unpriced change order. Unpriced contract modifications that implement VECPs shall:</p>
