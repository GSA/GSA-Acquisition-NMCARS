In addition, for purposes of this paragraph, a “level above the contracting officer” means the CCO or, if the CCO is less than two levels higher than the contracting officer, the Chief of the next higher contracting office. An individual so designated who has been personally and substantially involved with the procurement shall recuse himself or herself and, instead, refer the matter to another appropriate official at a comparable or higher level. </p>
