Determinations that sufficient personnel are <u class="ph u file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/NMCARS/NMCARS_Testing/dita/5237.204.ditau:1;11:376">not</u> readily available within the agency nor within another Federal agency shall be made in accordance with (d) below.</p>

The nature and extent of efforts an activity should pursue in obtaining information depend on the circumstances of the procurement, taking into consideration such factors as those listed in FAR 37.204(b), the specialized nature of the qualifications and expertise required, and the activity’s previous experience in attempting to identify similarly qualified personnel.</p>

The procedures in FAR Subpart 1.7 apply to HCA determinations made under this section.</p>
