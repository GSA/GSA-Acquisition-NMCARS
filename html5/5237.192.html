            requirement is waived for task orders valued below $250 million.</span> Multi-functional
         teams are highly encouraged to apply SAW-like steps to all services acquisitions valued at

Abbreviated SAW options are considered equivalent programs to a SAW and are encouraged to be used in lieu of requesting a SAW waiver. Other types of mission assistance workshops that are considered equivalent include, Acquisition and Management (DAU iCatalog “WSM”) and DAU’s Source Selection Simulation (“Triple-S”) workshop.</p>
