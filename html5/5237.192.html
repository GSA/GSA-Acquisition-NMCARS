For multiple award, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, a SAW is not required for the base contract, but is required for any task order valued at $100 million or more. However, per ASN(RDA) memorandum “Waiver of Certain Services Acquisition Workshops (SAWs) for the Remainder of Fiscal Year 2021,” dated 12 November 2020, except for Special Interest acquisitions, the mandatory requirement to conduct a SAW is waived through 30 September 2021. Multi-functional teams are highly encouraged to apply SAW-like steps to all services acquisitions valued at $10 million or more but less than the values above. If the HCA determines that a waiver is necessary, the waiver request shall be submitted by email to <a class="xref file:/home/ec2-user/ditatool/tce/NMCARS/NMCARS_Testing/dita/5237.192.ditaxref:1;14:38" href="mailto:SeniorServicesManage.fct@navy.mil" target="_blank">

Abbreviated SAW options are considered equivalent programs to a SAW and are encouraged to be used in lieu of requesting a SAW waiver. Other types of mission assistance workshops that are considered equivalent include, Acquisition and Management (DAU iCatalog “WSM”) and DAU’s Source Selection Simulation (“Triple-S”) workshop.</p>
