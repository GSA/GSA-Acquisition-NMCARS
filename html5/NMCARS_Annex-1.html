               statutory exception justifying use of other than full and open competition. This
               exception applies when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source
               in order to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development
               capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a
               federally funded research and development center (FFRDC). As a FFRDC, CNA is uniquely
               qualified to provide these services because of its unquestioned objectivity and lack
               of potential conflicts of interest, its confidentiality in protecting very sensitive
               military and intelligence information, its familiarity with the needs of the Navy and
               Marine Corps, and its establishment of a continuing research agenda for the Navy and
