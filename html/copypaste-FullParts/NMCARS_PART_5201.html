         controls to carefully manage and closely oversee the execution of delegated contracting
         authority for assigned contracting mission functions. This includes proactively working
         with requirements and program personnel during acquisition planning to facilitate the
         timely submission of requirements to the appropriate contracting activity for contract
         action in a manner which promotes and permits maximum competition. In conjunction with
         executing assigned contracting missions, there are certain types of procurements for which
         authority resides solely with the DON HCA as described in paragraph (c) below, unless
         authority is delegated in writing to another DON HCA and accepted by the receiving DON HCA
         to execute those procurements. Delegation of DON contracting authority applies only within
         the DON. Requirements executed outside of the DON shall follow the appropriate governing
         rules/regulations/policies (e.g., The Economy Act, Assisted Acquisition, FAR Part 17). At a
         minimum, DON HCAs shall address the following requirements and how they will be met in the

      <p class="p Normal" id="NMCARS_5201.6911__omTKDz">(a) The primary objective of procurement management oversight is to validate sound contracting practices throughout the DON. This oversight encourages and assists HCAs in making continuous improvements in their acquisition and procurement processes. It also provides a mechanism for sharing "best practices" throughout the DON. Procurement management oversight in the DON is conducted through the Procurement Performance Management Assessment Program (PPMAP). The PPMAP is a flexible, performance-based, process-oriented program that requires contracting activities to perform periodic self-assessments of:</p>
