               Industrial Sources Division, as part of their market research, provides more than 850
               commercial entities, on an annual basis, a listing of items for which it is seeking
               competitive sources, as well as instructions for obtaining source approval
               information. Additionally, the availability of the listing is periodically publicized
               in SAM and feedback is requested regarding market capabilities.To date, no other
               companies have expressed interest in becoming qualified to compete for the items to
               be acquired under the proposed contract.</em>

               NAVCOM's ABC Division, the Navy's Center of Excellence for XYZ systems, maintains
               in-depth knowledge of XYZ technology developments and the XYZ industrial base. This
               includes insight into technologies that individual companies are focused on and their
               technical and production capabilities. ABC Division representatives maintain this
               knowledge through routine review of industry journals and attendance at industry
               symposia and conferences. They also periodically visit industry facilities for
               briefings on companies' IR&amp;D efforts. Based on its knowledge and expertise, ABC
               Division has determined that no companies other than RST Corporation have the
               knowledge and technical capability required to provide the XYZ-24 systems. The lack
               of any responses to a synopsis of the planned contract published on the SAM website
               on June 5, 2005 validates ABC Division's determination.</em>

            <em class="ph i">Last month, the PEO/PM met with Senator Smith's staff to
               discuss the feasibility of using the XYZ system to meet our requirements in lieu of
               the ABC system. Although the PM provided a detailed explanation of why this would not
               be feasible, it's possible that Senator Smith will contact you directly to discuss
               this subject further. The PM is prepared to provide you with a briefing, as
               necessary.</em>
