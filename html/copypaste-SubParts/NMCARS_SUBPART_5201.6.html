In conjunction with executing assigned contracting missions, there are certain types of procurements for which authority resides solely with the DON HCA as described in paragraph (c) below, unless authority is delegated in writing to another DON HCA and accepted by the receiving DON HCA to execute those procurements. Delegation of DON contracting authority applies only within the DON. Requirements executed outside of the DON shall follow the appropriate governing rules/regulations/policies (e.g., The Economy Act, Assisted Acquisition, FAR Part 17). At a minimum, DON HCAs shall address the following requirements and how they will be met in the contracting activity’s procedures for delegation of contracting</p>

      <p class="p Normal" id="NMCARS_5201.6911__omTKDz">(a) The primary objective of procurement management oversight is to validate sound contracting practices throughout the DON. This oversight encourages and assists HCAs in making continuous improvements in their acquisition and procurement processes. It also provides a mechanism for sharing "best practices" throughout the DON. Procurement management oversight in the DON is conducted through the Procurement Performance Management Assessment Program (PPMAP). The PPMAP is a flexible, performance-based, process-oriented program that requires contracting activities to perform periodic self-assessments of:</p>
