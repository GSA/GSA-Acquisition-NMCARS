The DON Office of the General Counsel (OGC) has sole litigation authority for all appeals under DON contracts to the ASBCA. Because of the frequent complexity of these cases, the DON OGC and the contracting activity involved should maintain the continuity of any DON claim team that might have investigated and evaluated the contractor's claim submission. Such teams should continue to function in an assisting capacity under the leadership of the DON OGC Trial Attorney assigned to handle the appeal.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="YDuSoW" TCE:outputclass="Normal" class="YDuSoW Normal ">(b) <em TCE:source="i" TCE:Parent="p">Litigation report requirement</em>.

The conduct of settlement negotiations in connection with any pending appeal should generally be accomplished by a selected team consisting of the trial attorney and representatives of the contracting officer (including contracting activity technical personnel, counsel, negotiator, and auditor if necessary). Other arrangements may be made in specific cases as appropriate. However, no final settlement agreement will be made without the written approval of the contracting officer. When a settlement is made, a memorandum shall be prepared by the negotiating team (and signed by all team members) stating the basis and reasons. The settlement agreement shall be drafted by the contracting activity and trial attorney. The trial attorney shall file any legal papers required to be filed with the ASBCA to effect disposition of the case by mutual agreement of the parties.</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="RniJmY" TCE:outputclass="Normal" class="RniJmY Normal ">(d) <em TCE:source="i" TCE:Parent="p">Review and approval</em>.
