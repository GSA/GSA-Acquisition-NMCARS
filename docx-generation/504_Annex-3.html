An example would be that a list of all parts was assembled and a random number generator was used to select a specific percentage of the items.

Findings of Market Research</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="NHQajn" TCE:outputclass="List2" class="NHQajn List2 ">a. Materials/Suppliers – [Discuss manufacturers contacted, location of manufacturer and sources of supply, whether the manufacturer can track specialty metals to source, degree of compliance/non-compliance asserted, willingness to analyze parts for compliance if not already known, any conclusions as to veracity of compliance statements. If the manufacturer states its parts are compliant but the sources of supply (vendors) contradict or undermine this statement, this should be noted. If a manufacturer or supplier’s interpretation of the specialty metal requirements is incorrect, this should be noted. Examples of this would be an assumption that remelting of a specialty metal qualified or that the small purchase exception is applicable at lower tiers of subcontracting. If more than one part or type of specialty metal is involved in the DNAD, each should be treated in a separate section.]</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="VhNUoX" TCE:outputclass="List2" class="VhNUoX List2 ">b. State of Industry – [Discuss research done on the industry overall. This would include studies done by other organizations, annual industry sales and the US Government market share, information obtained from sources such as the Department of Commerce or National Association of Manufacturers, internet surveys conducted, information obtained from other DNADs, commercial aspects of the industry. Discuss what portion of manufacturers and/or suppliers are represented in this document and efforts to identify additional sources through means such as notices in the Commerce Business Daily or Urgent Data Requests through the Government Industry Data Exchange Program.]</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="IxlzEX" TCE:outputclass="List2" class="IxlzEX List2 ">c.

Alternative acquisition Strategies considered –[Explain any alternatives considered to buying the noncompliant material/part. These alternatives may include considering different end items to fulfill the requirement or using a different component/part in the end item. Effects of alternatives in terms of reengineering, delayed deliveries, mission impacts, etcetera, should be explained. Address the price reasonableness of buying compliant alternatives; can the price of the alternative be determined to be fair and reasonable?]</p><p TCE:source="p" TCE:Parent="conbody" TCE:id="CfAMvE" TCE:outputclass="Normal" class="CfAMvE Normal ">6.
